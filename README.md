built using .net 5.

/MergeProducts/Program.cs main method is the entry point of the program.

considered https://github.com/tosumitagrawal/codingskills/pull/4 when implementing.


if you have .net 5 sdk installed, open the .sln to build and run tests. Input files are located in MergeProducts/bin/Debug/net5.0/input, and output files are located in MergeProducts/bin/Debug/net5.0/output.

tests can be run by opening the .sln and running the tests.

if you dont have .net 5 sdk installed, you can run the self contained executables in MergeProducts/bin/Debug/net5.0/linux-x64/, MergeProducts/bin/Debug/net5.0/win-64/, MergeProducts/bin/Debug/net5.0/linux-x86/, you will also find the input and output folders respectively.
